# Machine Learning

It is recommended that you fork this repository for your own work, so that you can commit your changes to your own remote repository.

## Installation instructions

It is really recommended that you use "Anaconda" or "Miniconda" (which is a light version of Anaconda) as your Python installation and package manager. If you don't have it installed, do it. If you really want to handle things differently (e.g. use venv or the system's Python installation) you are on your own - the professor will not debug your Python environment.

Once Anaconda is available, run the following:

- Create the Anaconda environment for this course:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

- Activate the newly-created environment. Every time you want to work on this material you must activate the environment first.

```bash
conda activate ml
```
